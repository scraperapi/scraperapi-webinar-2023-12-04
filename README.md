# Example code from the scraperapi webinar conducted on December 4th, 2023.

This is the sample code we used in our webinar to illustrate:
1. Basic scraping with the API (basic.js);
2. Extended basic scraping to illustrate large volume, muli-server scraping (basicWithRedis.js);
3. Scraping with Structured Data Endpoints, to eliminate the need to extract and transform data from HTML (sde.js);
4. Scraping using our async service, to elimite the need to manage bulk submission and concurrency (async.js).

## Installation

To install, simply clone this repository, open a command prompt at the install directory and run ```npm install```.

## Running the Samples

Each sample can be run individually from the command prompt with, for example:
